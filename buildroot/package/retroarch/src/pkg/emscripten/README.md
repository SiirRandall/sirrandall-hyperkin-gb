# RetroArch Web Player

# Requirements
Most of the magic happens on the browser so nothing really on that regard

I you want a self hosted version you need
- A web server, nginx/apache will do, download a build here: 
  https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/emscripten/
- Extract the build somewhere in your web-server 
  - Grab the asset bundle:
  https://buildbot.libretro.com/assets/frontend/bundle.zip
- Unzip it in the same dir you extracted the rest, inside **/assets/frontend/bundle**
- Create an **assets/cores** dir, you can put game data in that dir so it's available under **downloads**
- chmod +x the indexer script
- run the indexer script (you need coffeescript) like this: ./indexer ./assets/frontend > ./assets/frontend/.index-xhr
- run the indexer script (you need coffeescript) like this: ./indexer ./assets/cores > ./assets/cores/.index-xhr

That should be it, you can add more cores to the list by editing index.html
